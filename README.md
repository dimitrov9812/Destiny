# Destiny
Voice Assistant (Voice recongition practice) 

## I decided to learn how to use voice recognition in C#. 
 -The idea was to create and assistant that could help and do actions like famous Voice Assistants 
 -When Destiny responds to anything she loops through different types of responses so she doesn't repeat herself  
 ### Until now she can tell you:  
    * What the time is. 
    * What the date is. 
    *She can open websites like.  
      -Google. 
      -Facebook.  
      -YouTube.  
    * She tells jokes (currently she reads the from a .txt file and chooses random joke to tell you). 
    * She tells stories which also reads from a .txt file. 
    *Searchs in google 
      * I provided a list of commonly used and searched words which when you tell Destiny to start seaching she can have a better understanding of what you whant to tell her. 
      *I must really learn how to improve that an make her understand me better.
    *She can also exit herself.
## I plan adding many features she can do and try to improve the recognition engine. 
      * Telling what is the weather in a desired location.  
      * Playing music. 
      * Improve the search process in google.
